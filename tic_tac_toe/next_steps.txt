Next steps:
  - Figure out the display (see board_design.rb)
  - code tie conditions (add a "tie?" check after the "win?" check in the game loop)
  - add "New Game?" once game finishes
  - clean up/shorten/split up methods in Game class

Potential features:
 - score keeper
 - error handling ("Invalid cell...", "Cell already has value in it...", etc.)
